"Subject: organization announcement  enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned  subsidiaries and venture companies worldwide . historically , the company has  conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented , decentralized manner  allowing each of the operating units the discretion to source their  requirements in a manner that optimizes unit performance . today , however ,  with the implementation of sap and the profound explosion in  internet / intranet - based technologies , we believe the company should change  its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategically  sourcing these requirements on a global basis . we believe that there are  significant cash savings to be extracted by the company and also commercial  potential for the formation of a highly profitable , business - to - business  e - commerce venture .  effective february 1 , 2000 , enron will form a new global strategic sourcing  unit . this new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic  sourcing initiatives underway in the gas pipeline group , global asset  operations and enron corp . initially , global strategic sourcing will focus  on aggregating enron  , s internal , joint venture and business partner demand  for products and services with the objective of creating a future  business - to - business e - commerce venture .  it gives us great pleasure to announce that george wasaff , managing director ,  will lead this new global initiative . george will report directly to mike  mcconnell , chief executive officer for global technology .  george has been with enron for fourteen years and has held many senior  executive positions , the most recent of which was managing director of enron  south america ' s wholesale operations . george was also the interim chief  executive officer of elektro from july 1998 through june 1999 and chief  executive officer of transportadora de gas del sur s . a .

"Subject: organizational changes  to : enron north america corp .  from : cliff baxter and kevin hannon  in july , as part of the enron north america ( ena ) reorganization , the  implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the  continued growth of ena including : 1 ) accelerate the development of our  people , 2 ) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets ,  and 3 ) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups , both  within ena and across enron . consistent with these objectives and with the  corporate goal of fostering   b ) the downstream coverage / origination groups which focus on delivering a  broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers  including pulp and paper , chemicals , plastics , refined products , metals and  mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation ,  textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u . s . midstream  coverage / origination groups which focus on energy , finance and industries .  downstream coverage / origination  as energy deregulation continues in north america , it is becoming clear that  the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both  ena and enron corp . further , it is clear that ena can significantly expand  its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial  solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron  corp . against this backdrop , the downstream coverage / origination function  will expand its product offering to include not only ena  , s existing energy  commodities , energy services , finance , assets and pulp and paper capabilities  but also ees  , s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel  , s chemicals ,  plastics and refined products risk management capability . these additional  capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels  groups . given the size and importance of this enron initiative , greg piper  will be returning from portland to manage this business . under greg  , s  leadership , the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three  sub - groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering :  a ) pulp and paper  ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage  activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for  the provision of innovative  products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision  of paper risk management products ;  b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to  lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be  responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the  chemicals and refined products industries ;  c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers  trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the  coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the  provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,  heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles  and glass manufacturing industries .  midstream coverage / origination  a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern  interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this  group ;  b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they  will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring  opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the  leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from  calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;  c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the  emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant  power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked  mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will  continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern  interconnect ;  d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring  opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing  restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have  asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,  formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of  citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join  this newly formed business .  2 ) commercial transactions :  the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff  donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of  transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing  transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity  of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction  development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity  structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical  analysis and upstream asset management .  the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,  execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction  with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of  which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this  dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service  and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg  resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to  the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :  a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and  western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group  include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy  lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of  capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today  from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power  origination .  b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial  origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,  environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is  established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay  boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing  two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .  c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant  services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior  members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and  john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the  vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we  anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few  weeks .  d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer  finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include  brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition  of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .  ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and  downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary  responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will  continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior  commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual  responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the  capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain  largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction  development teams and their respective origination groups will be located  together .  we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage  and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial  markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between  the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .  please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north  america by working with us to implement these changes .",0

"Subject: option hedging for ees  eugene ,  bob and i had a discussion about your question you raised yesterday .  for an option writer , he has the obligation to deliver , so he hedges it with  the underlying by adjesting delta positions . the hedging cost , theoretically ,  should be equal to the fair value of the option premium .  on the other hand , for the option holder , he has no obligation , by delta  heging ,  he would pay double for the option , with no upside . so he should not hedge  it at all .  if the option holder wants to protect the time value of the option , he should  sell  the option to the market or some equivalent options to create a theta - neutral  portfolio .  this may require trading in both the orginal and the equivalent option  underlyings .  our question to you , if the call options you mentioned are embedded in the  ees  contracts , say fixed price sale contracts , what makes it possible to just  separate those options  and sell them to the market to retain the full values of the options ? we  conjecture that these  options are meant to hedge the original contract . by selling those options  you eliminate the upside of the  original contract .  give one of us a call if you want to discuss this further .  zimin",0

"Subject: transport model  andy ,  the scale effect in the transport model can be explained .  i use a european option to do the illustration .  i raise the underlying and strike price by the same amount , use the fuel  percentage to adjust the strike .  the net result is the intrinsic value decreases as the level goes up .  if the fuel percentage is not very high , the option premium actually  increases with the level , although the  intrinsic value decreases .  if the fuel percentage is very high ( > 8 % ) , then we see a decreasing option  price .  in the transport deal , fuel change is often below 5 % , so you will not see a  decreasing spread option price  when nymex moves up . so i think the transport model still does what it  should do .  zimin  in the following exmaple , i used r = 6 % , vol = 20 % , t = 100 days , see spreadsheet  for details .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by zimin lu / hou / ect on 10 / 20 / 2000 01 : 24 pm  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  zimin lu  10 / 20 / 2000 10 : 45 am  to : andrew h lewis / hou / ect @ ect  cc : colleen sullivan / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect  subject : level effect in transport  andy ,  the following spread sheet domenstrates the leve effect in transport  valuation .  i add an "" nymex add - on "" to both delivery and receipt price curve before fuel  adjustment , keep everything else the same . the transport value ( pv of the  spread options )  increases when nymex add - on increases .  i can visit you at your desk if you have further question .  zimin",0

 just 90 days after following my systems ,  pat watson was $ 20 , 000 wealthier !  listen , you ' ve heard all the get rich now claims and you ' re sick of  seeing them ! the fact is most of those  people who claim to know how you can make money haven ' t made much money  themselves let alone taught others how to do it !  the difference between them and me is that i ' ve proven my  strategies time and time again in the national limelight and my systems truly  work in fact , i ' ve been dubbed america ' s # 1 millionaire maker .  right now , america and i need you for my upcoming nationwide tour to share your story of upcoming success and wealth to those who need hope - all across america .  let me tell you about a few of my "" money challenges "" . . . this is where i put my money where my mouth is :  i was also challenged by the los angeles times :  you might remember when the los angeles times challenged me to buy real  estate with nothing down . with a reporter by my side , $ 100 for living expenses ,  and armed only with my knowledge ; i purchased 7 properties worth $ 772 , 000 , all  in 57 hours .  i told the mayor of st louis missouri ( the show me state ) :  send me to any unemployment line . let me select someone who is broke , out of  work , discouraged . let me teach him in  two days time the secrets of wealth , and in 90 days he ' ll be back on his feet ,  with $ 5 , 000 cash in the bank , never to set foot in an employment line again .  i selected a young couple from the unemployment lines of st . louis , missouri .  ninety days later they earned $ 5 , 000 using one of my techniques , and . . . .  within 12 months they had earned over $ 100 k !  my proudest moments are when i coach starving millionaires ( people  who should be millionaires but aren ' t ) on wealth building strategies and see  them achieve extraordinary results , again and again !  i ' ve done these same challenges in other major cities - washington , d . c . ,  miami , boston , san diego , and new york - all with similar results !  this brings me to my next challenge in which i took all of the hype out  of the high - powered profit potential of the internet , and decided to make it a  reality for my students . i said :  sit me at any key board of any computer in the world with internet  access , and i will in 24 hours , earn at least $ 24 , 000 cash !  i got myself into the life or death mindset and i went to work  i started my internet challenge at exactly at 12 : 38 pm in front of live  television , i held my breath , and turned my system on and signed on to the  internet  in 6 hours and 11 minutes i had generated $ 46 , 684 . 95  then i went to sleep . . . and when i woke up the next morning and checked the computer -  ( with cameras rolling ) :  the total was now $ 78 , 827 . 44  this was exciting because i knew i still had four hours left !  that afternoon , 24 hours after the challenge had begun . . .  the total had grown to $ 94 , 532 . 44  in a mere 24 hours !  why do i tell you all of this ?

mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 .  i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came  straight to mit for a  ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first  three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,  optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in  psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,  and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in  particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and  companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my  phd thesis is "" pricing substitute products on the internet "" , and i am  sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will  give you an idea of what this research is about .  thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research  group next week .  paulo  pricing substitute products on the internet  objective :  to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold  on  the internet .  motivation :  this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and  optimization  models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological  innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of  information  which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .  furthermore ,  companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can  have access to .  the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue  faced  by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .  vcrs  or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about .  the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the  methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of  other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services .  research strategy :  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these  components are choice models and optimization models .  choice models :  choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice  remains .  these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models .  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet .  optimization :  traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term  profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know  your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must  therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component  ( learning ) .",0

what are the early warning signs of an impending  shakeout ?  - which ecommerce markets are most susceptible to a shakeout ? will there  be single or multiple winners ?  - which companies are likely to survive ? what strategies will the winners  use ?  there is controversy and uncertainty about which factors will most  contribute to prospects for survival . how important are first mover  advantages and building brand equity ? what do incumbents have to do to  prevail ? which business models are most robust ? how important is the  ability to manage strategic partnerships ?  these issues will be addressed with a program that encourages active  dialogue and interaction and includes speakers from industry , academia and  wall street .  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  agenda  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  dinner co - author of the best - selling books net  gain and net worth )  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  conference - riday , october 20  8 : 00 - 8 : 30 a  continental breakfast and  david reibstein , woodside prof . of marketing , wharton school and director ,  marketing science institute )  11 : 30 - 12 : 15 p  technology investing , 15 things that should be true  ( stephen j . andriole , senior vice president and chief technology officer ,  safeguard scientifics )  12 : 15 - 1 : 30  working lunch  participants will work in small groups . half the group will be asked to  select an ecommerce firm with a strong likelihood of winning and identify  the most important reasons for success ; the other half will be asked to do  the same for a firm that is likely to fail .  1 : 30 - 2 : 15  small group reports  2 : 15 - 3 : 00  finding a winning strategy  ( norman drapeau , chief executive officer of mro . com )  3 : 00 - 3 : 15 break  3 : 15 - 4 : 00  living through a consolidation  ( harry smilow , previously chief executive officer of telebank which is now  part of e * trade )  4 : 00 - 4 : 45  a view from wall street  ( henry blodget , first vice president and senior internet / e - commerce  analyst , merrill lynch )  4 : 45 - 5 : 00  sum up - what have we learned ?

"Subject: altos na gas model  kim , i know you have been interested in the development of a long term  natural gas model for use in the ets revenue management effort . i agree that  the ability to model various supply / demand scenarios for north america  should prove useful in ets business development efforts , and in particular ,  in predicting the impact of the new , large alaskan gas supplies on the n . a .  pipeline grid .  as you know , vince kaminski feels that a software product developed by dale  nesbitt ( marketpoint , inc . ) of los altos hills , ca . may be a good choice , and  one readily available in a relatively short time . marketpoint has proposed  that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and  testing , so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the  software . they have proposed a charge of $ 12 , 000 , plus expenses , for the  one - week session , with that cost applied to the first year ' s subscription  price ( approx . $ 55 - 60 m / yr ) should we decide to go forward . the other  details ( timing , ene resources required , necessary it interface , etc ) still  need to be worked out , but i believe there is generally a consensus to  proceed with the test .  with my recent relocation to the clean fuels group , i will no longer be  responsible for the alaskan pipeline development . however , danny mccarty is  pulling together a team consisting of people from nng , nbp and elsewhere in  ets to push the project forward . i believe eric gadd will be playing a key  role as well . the decision on the long term gas model should appropriately  be made by the new project team .  i have attached a draft of the proposed marketpoint license agreement . it  has not yet been fully reviewed by legal ( or by shelley c . for the  "" affiliate "" issues ) .  let me know if i can provide any other background or assistance .  jng",0

"Subject: alliance info alert : ferc report on western markets  at its special meeting today , ferc released the results of its eagerly  awaited probe into california ' s summer power crisis , concluding that under  certain circumstances , california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and  unreasonable power rates due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market  structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions  throughout the west .  the ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer 2000  price abormalities , entitled , part i of staff report on u . s . bulk power  markets , is available at the following website :  in response , ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural  changes to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems , and  solicited public comment by november 22 . a technical conference has also  been scheduled for november 9 , to discuss the proposed solutions and other  remedies that might be suggested ( details tba ) . while all four commissioners  supported the order , the order stretched the commission . chairman hoecker  and comm . breathitt expressed strong endorsements , while comms . hebert and  massey concurred , citing areas where they felt the commission had either  "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , as discussed below . a final order is  expected to be issued by year ' s end .  at the same time , the commission warned california consumers of their  continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve  state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day  ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 )  siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient  reserve requirements .  highlights of proposed california structural remedy  in its order , ferc proposed a series of market overhauls , including :  ( 1 ) eliminating the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s  investor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px , and allowing  these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other  alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks .  ( 2 ) requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their  transactions in the day - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for  under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements ) , in  order to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market .  ( 3 ) establishing independent , non - stakeholder governing boards for the iso  and px .  ( 4 ) modifying the current single price auction system by ( a ) imposing a  temporary $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap "" that prohibits supply bids in excess of $ 150  from setting the market - clearing price for all bidders ; ( b ) requiring sellers  bidding above $ 150 / mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential , weekly  basis and provide certain cost support ; and ( c ) requiring the iso and px to  report monthly information on such bids . the commission ' s price mitigation  measures would remain in effect through december 31 , 2002 .  ( 5 ) declining to order retroactive refunds for the state ' s ratepayers and  utilities , citing insufficient authority to do so , but subjecting sellers to  potential refund liability for transactions from october 2 , 2000 until  december 21 , 2002 , but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs , if  ferc finds non - competitive behavior .  ( 6 ) encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand  response management programs .  separately , the draft order rejected the iso ' s request for an extension of  its current purchase price cap authority , and the px ' s request for price  capping authority .  commissioner responses  comm . herbert reluctantly concurred , noting that his decision may change when  a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at  the november 9 meeting . he stressed that he would have preferred that the  order address four areas : ( 1 ) eliminate all price controls in california  markets ; ( 2 ) abolish the single price auction entirely ; ( 3 ) terminate the  "" buy and sell "" mandate in the px ; and ( 4 ) direct the iso to address a long  list of cited problems in its january 2001 rto filing , rather than having the  commission prescribe specific remedies .  hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the "" soft cap ""  concept , if one had to be adopted , then the soft cap should increase  incrementally increase over time at specific pre - announced dates . he  believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in  facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive  for california regulators to address market design and other flaws . also , he  would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time , but  allow the iso and px to address this issue in their january 2001 rto  filings . in addition , he would not dictate risk management methods ,  preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on  their own . finally , he advised californians not to be so environmentally  focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation  capacity .  comm . breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc  cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that it was the commission ' s  job to guide the market to self - correct and not to conduct "" command and  control . "" she also commended the managers of the iso and px , saying that  they have performed admirably . however , she noted she is awaiting comments  on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential  reporting requirements .  comm . massey concurred , but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive  approach . he feels that the congress has "" put its thumb on the scale "" in the  federal power act to protect consumers . stating that prices will continue to  be unreasonable in the future , he believes that this order moves in the right  direction , by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over  reliance on the spot market , lack of demand response , the need to  reconstitute governance of the iso and px and the elimination of the buy / sell  mandate . comm . massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the  $ 150 / mwh soft cap went far enough , whether ferc has the legal authority to  issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a  certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market  price volatility .  finally , chairman hoecker stated his strong support of the order , but noted  that this is "" no time to pull punches . "" he emphasized that the commission  needed frank comments from the industry . he echoed comm . breathitt ' s warning  that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on  track . noting that the commission lacked authority to order refunds , he  stated that the responsibility rests with congress . addressing  jurisdictional issues , he stated that siting problems encountered at the  state level are slowing the "" meandering transition "" to competition . he feels  that the state of california and ferc need to work together to resolve these  problems and that ferc is not attempting to usurp power . rather , california  is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region  for reliable energy , thus placing the burden on federal action to make things  work , hoecker maintained . the chairman also said that the commission will  fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further  evidence provided by staff ' s ongoing investigation .  if you have any questions or comments , please call jack cashin at  202 / 508 - 5499 .",0

"Subject: energy leader consulting generation evaluator ( ege )  shirley :  as requested , herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski .  the presentation on the ege tool ' s applications and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour . if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday , may 29 , might i request it be set for late afternoon ( as my other appointments are the next day ) .  and , as vince will recall , i was co - leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly , and developer of the ramp up , real time , 75 check and electric strategy tools . presently , i am ceo of energy leader consulting ( elc ) .  background  the u . s . power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years . rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively . utilities , who still control most power plants , endeavor to adopt the entrants ' methods . yet , inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread .  utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades - old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling . many utilities , notwithstanding the industry - wide trend towards profit maximization , cling to ingrained routines .  inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale . a utility may operate a relatively small system ( fewer than a dozen plants ) . a small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers , playing the wholesale market at the margin .  for a variety of reasons , utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units , let alone shut down any ( even temporarily or seasonally ) . economically inefficient units continue to be committed , week after week , and run in the half - load range .  ege objectives  ege identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines . taking into account transmission and reliability factors , the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant .  i . an industry participant can use ege as a basis for a medium or long - term wholesale power transaction with a utility ; or to price wholesale power more aggressively , to take market share from the utility ( i . e . , compel changes in unit commitment habits ) .  ii . an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition .  iii . a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility ' s unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized .  specific ege concepts  ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities .  it produces indicative statistics such as :  a . the frequency distribution of starts per week ;  b . the frequency distribution of starts by day / 15 - minute segment during the week ;  c . the frequency distribution of load level ;  d . the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start ;  e . average heat rate and approximate fully - allocated cost in the half - load range ;  f . average ramp rate from the half - load range ;  g . the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours ; and  h . forced - off maintenance outage rate ( where indicated ) .  indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month / year ; in some cases , by temperature range . ( they can be by regional wholesale prices as well . ) ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years .  ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data . ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 ( through december 31 , 2000 ) . ege lst quarter 2000 ( through march 31 , 2001 ) will be available approximately june 15 , 2001 .  ege also compares and ranks generating units ' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility ( as well as other regional generators ) . some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half - load level for lengthy time periods ( without an apparent reliability basis ) , splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units .  other ege supporting data :  i . planned maintenance schedule ( where indicated ) ;  j . actual maximum generating capacity ;  k . actual minimum generating capacity ( actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government - reported values ) ;  l . average heat rate in the full - load range ; and  m . average heat rate in the three - quarter - load range .  with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region . it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters .  the real - world example of allegheny energy  allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege . in the 4 th quarter 2000 , for instance , one high - cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning ( 52 times ) and committed for the whole day ( in all but two cases ) . arguably , there are power products that could substitute for this routine ( in part at least ) at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy .  another high - cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn ( nine times ) and committed for most of the coming week . at another plant , two high - cost units were operated too often in the expensive half - load range ( some 550 hours ) and three - quarter - load range ( another 400 to 600 hours ) ; they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels . again , there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy .  offering of energy leader consulting ( elc )  ege is a procedure , not a software package or data base . elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities .  elc transfers its "" knowledge "" about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight - forward four - step process :  1 . enron would select one to three target utilities .  2 . elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities .  3 . employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) .  4 . optionally , elc would provide ege supporting data , quarterly , to enron .  the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program ( virtually all fossil fuel units ) . parameters that are incorporated , and the data set format , will be specified upon request . custom modifications will be considered .  steven a . mitnick  chief executive officer  energy leader consulting  4807 41 st street , nw  washington , dc 20016  ( 202 ) 997 - 0924 voice  ( 202 ) 537 - 0906 fax  smitnick @ energyleader . com",0

"Subject: re : insead high - tech acquisitions workshop  ben  thanks for attending . i was on "" vacation "" last week ( driving from ca to  houston )  and could not answer your first message regardoing insead conference in time .  the objective was to find out more about the he workshop on high - tech  acquisitions  and evaluate the usefulness of the program for enron . i shall be making a  recommendation  to jeff skilling that we should work with wharton as a partner in a number of  different research projects .  i shall try to catch you next week to find out what was said about valuation  of small high - tech firms .  vince  benjamin parsons  06 / 12 / 2000 05 : 50 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : bryan seyfried / lon / ect @ ect  subject : insead high - tech acquisitions workshop  vince  i attended the workshop on high - tech acquisitions at insead on saturday  alongside participants from cisco , eads , razorfish and cable + wireless , and  academics from insead and wharton . the basic premise was to discuss and get  feedback from practitioners about the research project , and a phd study which  is currently underway at wharton . the discussions were very interesting -  especially as this was my first exposure to this area .  examples of the discussions raised include  why firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them in - house  what degree of post - acquisition integration was optimal  difficulties of us firms acquiring euro / asian high - tech companies  how to value small high - tech firms  how to quantify the success / failure of an acquisition  my feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to  enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give  us first - hand access to the results . plus it would enable us to learn from  the mistakes of others , through meeting practitioners at such workshops and  having greater access to the case studies . i guess it could also aid our  realignment within the high - tech / communication industry to be seen in such  studies .  regards  ben",0

"Subject: p + option valuation model  mark ,  after recently reviewing the booking of the p + options , it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes ( i . e . the price process assumptions are consistent with standard black - 76 model assumptions extended to two commodities ) .  the payoff for a call option is :  payoff = max ( 0 , a - b - k ) .  where :  a = nxwti ( delivery price for nymex )  b = posting price = ( wti swap ) - ( posting basis )  k = posting bonus ( fixed ) .  the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options is that leg "" b "" of the spread is a combination of three prices , the two futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month , and the average posting basis during the delivery month . combination of these prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg "" b "" and the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of prices and its correlation with the nxwti price . i believe that this approach is more straightforward than the alternative , which would be to use a three or four - commodity model with its associated volatility and correlation matrices .  in summary , i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of these types of options , assuming that the inputs are set correctly .  regards ,  stinson gibner  v . p . research",0

"Subject: re : progress  steve ,  thanks a lot . i think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards  understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no  bugs in translation of a business problem ( for example , complicated  credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality ) into the  code .  regarding tanya ' s attitude . just a few points .  1 . i don ' t think she has the skills to do the system administrator ' s work  and she does not have the  necessary privileges . this explains why she keeps asking winston for help .  it ' s  not that the work is beneath her .  2 . some members of tanya ' s team came to me complaining about winston .  he effectively told them to go away and work on the "" research projects ""  and that he would take care of the it issues . i don ' t think that it ' s just  tanya ' s issue ,  though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful .  3 . the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on  tanya and  me whenever there is any performance problems and / or they intuitively  disagree with the results of a run . they could not care less about the  demarcation line between it and research . they also want tanya  to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code .  the bottom line is that we are in full agreement : tanya and  winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that  it happens .  credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and  the system cannot fail .  vince  from : stephen stock / enron @ enronxgate on 01 / 11 / 2001 08 : 23 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : progress  vince ,  i got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking  about some specific solutions to performance of it systems . . . in particular  distributed processing . also i heard that you had concerns about the use of  multiple languages etc . . . .  both of these sound like what i was discussing with you on previous  occasions . . . do you feel the need to discuss these further ?  the multi - language issue isn ' t really that much of an issue , as the current  system is 98 % java right now . although i am a big fan of c / c + + ( it is my main  development skill ) , i am also very aware that java is a much more evolved  and robust language . i had serious doubts about the performance , but i ' ve had  a review conducted , and the results are showing the sun unix implementation  to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than c / c + + because of something  they call hot - spot technology . ( its an instruction caching technique , i  believe ) . the concerns i expressed to you , were really about how technical  people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively  meaningless metric like portability .  on the issue of distributed processing . . . the original review i had conducted  by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution , and as zhiyong wei  is already working on global valuation project , winston is actively working  with zhiyong to see if he can model the var architecture on that , and also to  find a common valuation piece between the systems .  i ' d like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some  time over the next few days ?  also , i sat in on the tanya / winston meeting yesterday and as per our  discussion at the elevator , i attempted to help her argument by suggesting to  all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code . . . i . e .  seperating research domain problems from it problems .  she said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could  get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were . i asked her how she would  measure that , and she said she would instrument the code manually by  inserting timing elements at strategic points . i mentioned that a profiling  tool could probably do this job for her . tanya again said that stepping  through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code , and that  studying documentation wasn ' t enough .  about 6 weeks ago , i commissioned a team to document the system down to  psuedo - code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon .  ( in fact i ' ve asked for a draft copy to be given to tanya right now ) , and  winston is also working on a draft research / it "" working together "" document ,  which will identify how the exchange of information takes place .  tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated it developer to do  all the environment setup for her , because she doesn ' t really want to have to  do that . i think that this is probably the root cause of the issue . the it  guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good , as  it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her . she is  claiming that they are un - cooperative . . . . they are claiming that she  continually asks the same questions about set - up over and over again , and  doesn ' t seem to want to learn how to do it . winston on the other hand , could  be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and  an it issue and ask for help from research .  i think you debbie and i need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely .  i have asked tanya and winston to go ahead and work very closely together  over the next few days . . . . and debbie brackett and i will review their  progress on friday .  in the meantime l ' ll be looking at setting up a working test environment that  doesn ' t involve my main quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer  term solution .  regards  steve",0

"Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01  if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 .  bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack  of support  sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans  and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is  reportedly "" unwilling to fight "" for davis . many legislative republicans and  democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the  bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would "" double dip "" into  the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place .  additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term  power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the  bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of  contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very  difficult .  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would "" eat "" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general  fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8  billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this  concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the  details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward .  currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab  31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill  passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of  republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen ,  currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be  likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature ,  republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated  that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued .  other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the  republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally ,  lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .  key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b  lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b  lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b  bear stearns $ 625 m  tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt  projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 %  tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 %  current projected  blended ir : 5 . 38 %  maturity date : august 29 , 2001  for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510  bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the  california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion  authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these  authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the  governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb  6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for  the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this  idea earlier in the crisis .  socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the  first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the  governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is  august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according  to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has  signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis  and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash .  the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond  issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan )  stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers ,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the  state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and  passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for  bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the dwr proportionately from rate payments .",0

"Subject: california update - urgent please read 5 / 7 / 01  sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today  the bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the california  assembly . the republicans are currently in caucus until 3 : 30 pst and then  will go to the floor for a vote . the current situation is very fluid , but  sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote ,  lacking the two - thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance . if this is the  case , the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be  forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans . absent of last minute  financial rescues by davis or a new longer bridge loan package ( unlikely )  socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy . the main problem would then be the  waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission  line purchase or other assistance .  there is an outside chance that republican defectors could precipitate from  the current caucus . there is extreme pressure on the republicans from davis  and angelides . if the bill failed due to lack of republican support , it  would provide davis the opportunity to blame republicans for on - going  expenditures of $ 70 m / day ( power purchases ) , and a possible bankruptcy by  socal . the last republican who gave support to a democratic bill ( ab lx ) ,  representative bill campbell , lost his job . sources also confirm that  democrats have not met with republicans on the bond issuance since last week .",0

"Subject: dhabol  jeff ,  we shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from sandeep with the  numbers you have  requested . what follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on  the power situation in india  published by the financial times .  the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting  millions of people .  one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due  to power  shortages . it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced  by the dhabol plant ( expensive as it may be ) . the power cut affected 230  million people .  the second article is enron specific .  vince  asia - pacific : power failure hits north india  financial times ; jan 3 , 2001  by angus donald  tens of millions of people were left without electricity  in northern india  yesterday after a power grid breakdown .  electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and  most parts of the  capital new delhi , with 60 to 70 per cent of supply  expected to be restored  by the end of the day , according to power grid  officials .  the associated chambers of commerce and industry  ( assocham ) , a  leading business organisation , expressed "" deep concern ""  and called for a  mechanism to prevent future disruption that could  "" cripple the economy "" .  the power failure across eight indian states , including  new delhi , disrupted  train services , water supplies and the telephone network  and forced  hospitals to switch to emergency generators .  the fault occurred on the northern grid , which provides  electricity for 226 m  people , and affected the states of delhi , haryana ,  punjab , uttar pradesh ,  himachal pradesh , madhya pradesh , rajasthan and jammu  and kashmir .  a breakdown at a sub - station in kanpur in uttar pradesh ,  india ' s most  populous state , caused an overload of power on other  lines , which then  failed as well .  trains stopped running for most of the day and signals  systems were  damaged . new delhi international airport was also  slightly affected before  its own power supply could be engaged .  "" we will probe into the reasons for the failure . it is  most likely to be a  technical failure , but we will investigate why it  happened , "" suresh prabhu ,  the power minister , was quoted as saying by press trust  of india .  india suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to  upgrade infrastructure . theft of supplies is also a big  problem . thirty per  cent of the country ' s electricity is stolen , according  to analysts . in new  delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen .  two years ago , a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh  and delhi for  hours .  assocham issued a statement , saying that increasing  industrial demand  would exacerbate the problems already faced by india ' s  inefficient power  sector . "" the slow progress , particularly in  strengthening the transmission  and distribution system , and ever increasing theft will  contribute to  worsening the power supply situation further .

"" india has lost time and opportunity and has driven  returns down by six  percentage points , "" says gerry grove - white , former india  general manager  of powergen , which has sold its 655 mw plant in gujarat  to china light &  power of hong kong .  india ' s national plan for the five years to 2002 says  generating capacity  must rise by 40 , 000 mw to about 120 , 000 mw . but since  1992 , ipps have  added only 3 , 000 mw and 2 , 500 mw remains under  construction . this is  insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8  per cent economic  growth .  enron was a bellwether of india ' s liberalisation ,  winning fast - track project  approval in the early 1990 s . phase 1 , a 740 mw plant  fuelled by expensive  naphtha came on stream in may 1999 , and phase 2 , a  dollars 1 . 87 bn plant  of 1 , 624 mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas ( lng ) ,  will be completed this year . only two of seven other  fast - track proposals  have achieved financial closure .  from the outset enron encountered attacks , culminating  in maharashtra ' s  then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating  terms no less onerous . vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister  of the successor  government , says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable .  enron , whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists , wants to maintain  good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment . enron views  india as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of  power plants to a broad - based trader of commodities ,  such as energy , gas  and bandwidth .  to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy  between power  surplus and deficit states , once legislation is passed  this year . it is building  an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas . and it is  laying a 15 , 000 km fibre - optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country  desperately short of this new economy commodity .  in any event , enron believes it has a watertight  contract . it is supported by  many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor  perception of maharashtra , india ' s financial and  industrial hub , as an  unreliable destination for investment .  mr deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his  predecessor , which  threatened to "" dump dabhol into the arabian sea "" - is  under pressure from  radical members of his wobbly coalition . but his options  are limited .  scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state  that would have to compensate shareholders .  maharashtra state electricity board , the local utility  and enron ' s main  client , is obliged to dispatch or "" off - take "" 90 per cent  of dabhol ' s output . yet  mseb has never honoured these guarantees . its off - take  has averaged 60  per cent since the plant opened and , in effect , mseb has  been paying a lot  more while consuming a lot less power .  one reason off - take is low is because the state ' s tough  new regulator has  told mseb to buy from cheaper sources . enron says the  tariff would be  rs 4 . 02 / kwh if mseb ' s off - take averaged 90 per cent . but  with off - take a  third lower , the average tariff is rs 4 . 94 per unit , and  often higher . in  october , the tariff was rs 6 . 91 per unit , when off - take  was about 49 per  cent . enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 ,  run on cheaper  lng , starts .  these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only  half of a 30 per  cent equity option in phase 2 . enron has acquired the  balance and  mandated bankers to find a buyer .  enron ' s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps ,  which have failed to  deliver the flood of investments . potential ipps feared  they would never be  paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt  management of power .  reform of state electricity boards , whose uneconomic  pricing means  industrial users subsidise poor farmers , as well as  transmission and  distribution ( t & d ) services to check huge theft and  technical losses , is  overdue . "" given the limited resources , money would be  better spent on t & d  rather than on new plant , "" says oliver blackaby ,  managing director of n m  rothschild in india , which is advising karnataka on the  privatisation of its  distribution network .  for the moment , attention is fixed on enron ' s ability to  satisfy the  competing interests of investors and clients . as sanjay  bhatnagar , chief  executive officer of enron india , said in a recent trade  magazine , one of the  key lessons learned from phase 2 is "" having flexibility  to deal with  externalities "" .  copyright : the financial times limited  , copyright the financial times limited 2000 .

( as of june  19 )  2 ) looking at copper position you calculate a var of - 3 , 100 , 568 with a  total outright of 63 . 765 mt .  this seams too low . if i calculate 63765 x 1807 x 3 . 99 % = 4 . 218 mil . us $ . var  ( outright qty x price levelx risk factor , riskfactr as per mercur ) .  in my view we have been understating var in mercur because we do not  consider the spread position correctly ( i . e . in detail ) . on a position like  that i would expect a figure of around 6 mil us $ .  i guess the issue is in the volatility and in the holding period .  3 ) your correlation matrix for the commodities is not final i assume as  many fields are blank .  lets talk tomorrow on the phone .  attached please find the position summary for the last week # 30 ( since june  19 ) as requested by kirstee .

"Subject: re : option pricing challenge  zimin ,  to generalize your initial comment , for any process ds = mu ( s , t ) * s * dt +  sigma ( s , t ) * s * dz ,  the delta - hedging argument leads to the black - scholes pde .  this is true for any arbitrary functions mu and sigma , and so includes gbm ,  mean reversion , and others .  there is no problem with this , because in the risk - neutral world , which is  what you enter if you can hedge ,  the drift of the "" actual "" process is irrelevant .  i believe your concern is that you would like to see a different option price  for mean reversion process . this can only happen if the asset is not  hedgeable , and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the  option pricing . if you assume that the underlying is a non - traded factor ,  then the pde will have to reflect the market price of risk , and the drift of  the actual process is then reflected in the pde .  vasant  zimin lu  10 / 17 / 2000 05 : 20 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vasant  shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , pinnamaneni krishnarao / hou / ect @ ect , alex  huang / corp / enron @ enron , kevin kindall / corp / enron @ enron , tanya  tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : option pricing challenge  dear all ,  i have a fundamental question back in my mind since 95 . hope you can give  me a convincing answer .  zimin  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  in deriving bs differential equation , we assume the underlying follows gbm  ds = mu * s * dt + sigma * s * dz  where mu is the drift , sigma is the volatility , both can be a function of s .  then we use delta hedging argument , we obtain the bs differential equation  for the option price , regardless  of mu .  with the bs pde and boundary condition , we can derive bs formula . fine . no  problem .  question comes here . suppose the underlying is traded security and follows ,  say , mean - reverting process  ds = beta ( alpha - s ) dt + sigma * s * dz  apparantly , this sde leads to a different probability distribution . however ,  using the delta hedging argument ,  we still get the same bs differential equation , with the same boumdary  condition , we get the same bs formula .  not fair !  from another angle , i can derive the distribution from the bs pde for the  underlying , which is the lognormal distribution .  my thinking is : can i drive the distribution for any sde from the option pde  ? the answer should be yes , but got to be  from a different pde rather than bs pde . then what we do about the  delta - hedging argument ?  thanks .",0

"Subject: re : real options presentation  thanks for the comments grant . the presentation is for a couple of external  conferences that vince volunteered me for - vince has ok ' d the content , and  stinson raised exactly the same issues as you . unfortunately i just don ' t  seem to be getting any response from risk whatsoever on the publication of my  article , so these conferences will be the public debut for my real options  notation .  of course the discounting / risk neutrality thing is where the real judgement  sits . when questions arise i ' ll take the line that while research formulates  the models using appropriate derivatives / market based valuation methods , we  work with our rac group which considers the discounting to be associated with  various risks , and chooses these rates appropriately . the notation makes  clear which uncertainties we are exposed to at different stages of the deals ,  which assists in choosing the rates .  in practice i ' m not yet at the stage where originators are using my notation  yet - another reason i can ' t say too much about its actual use at the  conference . i ' m producing various tools for deterministic hydro  optimization , gbm swing option valuation , and deterministic dp optimization  for genset dispatch which people want right now - i ' m working in the  background on the kind of modelling my notation demands . people are getting  to know me as a guy who can solve their immediate problems , and they ' ll be  more likely to listen when i start rolling out the "" proper "" options - based  models . my notation is currently used only in the specs i ' m writing for the  tools i ' m producing .  i ' ll be turning dale ' s spreadsheet - based power plant spread model into an  american monte carlo tool , which will then be available for inclusion in  other models . i think by the end of the summer the real options theoretical  work will start to bear fruit , one year after i initially proposed the  notation . with the quant it group i ' m co - creating in place , i may yet see  the automated diagramming / pricing tool made real .  thanks also for the pointer to tom halliburton . the use of the lingo  lp / integer package is something i ' ve been presented with for the teesside  plant operation optimizer , rather than something i chose . the perm ( physical  energy risk mgt ) group just got a couple of analysts to hack it together  ( including natasha danilochkina ) , then asked me to tidy it up when it didn ' t  work . they are going to use their existing faulty model for now ( to meet  their project deadlines ) , and i ' m sketching out a proper mathematical spec  for the problem .  i ' ve persuaded ( ! ) them that this sort of business - critical system should be  developed properly by research , and they now seem happy to fall into line .  their wilton plant optimizer was developed by one peter morawitz , the guy i  hoped to recruit into research , and they obviously didn ' t realise he was  better than average at quantitative modelling . anyway they now accept that  doing it properly will take months rather than weeks , and i ' ll have a freer  hand in my choice of modelling tool - so a chat with tom would be extremely  valuable .  cheers ,  steve  enron capital is  this an internal enron or external presentation ? if external , i would say it  is just at the limit before sliding into proprietary stuff . perhaps that ' s  why you ' ve neatly almost entirely avoided questions about discounting and  risk - neutrality or lack of it ?  regards ,  grant .",0

( in high speed communication bandwidth scenarios , for example ,  the dimensions could be price , bandwidth size , time for which bandwidth  available , continguity of the allocation , and such . )  2 ) it involves dynamic matching as opposed to "" static "" matching .  3 ) it is multi - lateral .  4 ) it adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions .  5 ) it allows traders to make important trade - offs , as they do in  traditional markets .  currently , skg is involved in discussions with the heads of trading at  fidelity , putnam investments , lehman bros . , kpmg , meridien research ,  salomon smith barney , jp morgan , state street , banc of america , mckinsey ,  citizens power , and a host of other folks .  we think we have a value - adding service to provide to enron online or any  other enron subsidiary that the skg offering matches and that you deem fit .  skg ' s founders and i will be very happy to provide you or your  representative ( s ) with more details , including a demo of the prototype , in  a meeting . we are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange  something appropriate .  thanks very much , jeff ! we look forward to hearing from you .  with warm regards ,  joseph cherian and robert jarrow  cc : professor robert c . merton  joseph a . cherian  associate professor of finance  boston university school of management  595 commonwealth avenue , room 522 h  boston , ma 02215  tel : 617 - 353 - 2679 ( o )  617 - 353 - 6667 ( fax )",0

"" that was my  motivation . the second problem was that the logos themselves , even if it  made sense to do them in gold , made the design too busy - a lot of the  appeal in these "" word "" mugs is the clean , linear look . finally , i think  lack of company and competing business school logos increases the chances  that the academics who come to present their work at our workshop will  display this mug on their desk or on their shelves .  i think the mug will look quite stunning and i think the display of finance  terms will make it an interesting conversion piece - i ' ve never seen  anything like it in academics , let alone in finance . i think enron ' s  sponsorship of the seminar series will get noticed when people follow their  interest in the mugs to say "" what is this ? where ' d this come from ?

is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison  investment ?  * * this is a good point . i was thinking in terms of the average variance ,  but this may not be correct . actually , we know that this is just an  approximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good  approximation . typically , firms tend to ignore issues relating to the  duration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate ,  which clearly does not make sense . this requires some additional thought . * *  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the  investment and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this  model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and  endogenously determines the discount rate .  * * this is correct . my goal was to come up with something that was closely  related to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into  how to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate . there are a  number of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure . what we need  to first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the  kind of projects that you are evaluating . * *  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available  from the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as  the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being  more or less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field  to be 10 years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable  operating costs . it might be useful for you to think about applying the  framework to this problem .  * * this problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely  that the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing .  hence , there is no need to be concerned about risk capital ( other than the  x million dollars to buy and develop the property ) . to value the property  assuming all - equity financing we calculate the value process of the  developed project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment  whose value process is observable ( e . g . , a traded mlp ) . the risk - adjusted  return of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash  flows of the gas field .  please note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and  calculating the risk - adjusted return on the comparison investment is not  necessarily straightforward . * *  let me know when you would like to discuss this .  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  on another topic , is it possible for you to give me information about one  case where enron bought or sold a base load power plant , where the  purchaser financed the transaction with non - recourse debt . we would like  the following information :  1 . the value of the power plant ( or purchase price )  2 . the amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract .  3 . some information about the pricing of gas - power swaps and options .  about a year ago i gave vince a paper which develops a pricing model for  project debt . i don ' t think he thought that it could be implemented on the  type of projects that enron finances . however , my coauthors would like to  try applying the model for one case study .  let me know when you want to discuss these issues .  thanks ,  sheridan  sheridan titman  department of finance  college of business administration  university of texas  austin , texas 78712 - 1179  512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone )  512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax )  titman @ mail . utexas . edu",0

"Subject: alliance info alert - ferc reporting  attached is a summary of recent ferc activities ( pdf file ) and the weekly  alliance express . the following is a summary of the most recent ferc meeting ,  followed by a listing of the most recent ferc filings .  in a brief meeting yesterday , ferc approved a final rule adopting section 203  merger filing requirements , generally as proposed , and extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time that the new york market can be  determined to be "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a  technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and  urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next  steps , and deadlines for resolution / implementation . additional details are  provided below .  ferc updates , streamlines merger filing process  ferc unanimously approved its proposed order revising the reporting  requirements for mergers . however , comm . hebert did so with reservations , as  discussed below . commission staff stated that the order closely follows the  notice of proposed rulemaking previously issued , but adds more detail and  more certainty to the industry . staff stated that the order is improved over  the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain  entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products .  according to ferc , the draft order :  - revises the commission ' s filing requirements to reflect existing merger  policy based on ferc ' s 1996 merger policy guidelines ;  - provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market  analyses . the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with  potential horizontal competitive concerns . in addition , the rule establishes  informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses .  - streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise  competitive concerns ; and  - reduces the industry ' s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing  requirements .  the rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal  register .  commissioner reaction :  comm . hebert expressed reservations that , although he was voting for the  rule , ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice ( doj ) and the  federal trade commission ( ftc ) market concentration analyses and that ferc  should follow the lead of anti - trust enforcement officials , who could also  analyze mergers faster and more confidentially . he also stated that ferc  should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them , not before ,  and that there should be a definite time frame for review . hebert did  mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission  assets would be exempt , that ancillary services would be considered as a  separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative  market analysis .  comm . breathitt supported the final rule , stating that it should expedite the  approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the  fact that older , irrelevant requirements have been dropped . she indicated  that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting  the public interest by stating that the process will be "" efficient yet  sufficient "" . the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule  addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail  competition and one of her main concerns , confidentiality .  comm . massey fully supported the final rule , emphasizing that it would  improve response time , lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the  industry to better predict commission actions . like commissioner breathitt ,  massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that  will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants  to point to other factors when concentration appears too high . massey also  stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc ' s  concerns , such as future mergers when they occur in succession , retail  competition , mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and  analysis of ancillary services . in sum , he averred that the order will  provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis , while taking into  consideration the rapid changes in the industry .  chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was  a very important rule . in response to comm . hebert , chairman hoecker said  that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc ' s report before issuing their  own , that the anti - trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc ' s expertise when  reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries . there is a major  positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are  reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work , he noted . because the  rtos enlarge the size of the subject market , he indicated , rtos will help to  preserve competition . therefore , more and larger rtos should allow for more  mergers , he said . the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that  joining an rto is a requirement for a merger , but that it would certainly be  viewed favorably .  nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably  competitive  in a 3 - 1 decision , with comm . hebert dissenting , ferc extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be  "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a technical  conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market  participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and  deadlines for resolution / implementation .  in so doing , ferc rejected certain aspects of nyiso ' s september 1 and 8 , 2000  compliance filing , submitted pursuant to its may 31 , 2000 order imposing a  temporary bid cap through october 31 . the iso ' s efforts to correct market  flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had  not yet satisfied the commission ' s directives , ferc concluded . ferc found  that while nyiso has achieved solid progress in certain areas , overall the  iso has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then  gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the iso ' s non - spinning reserve  market by april 2001 , as the iso requested .  commissioner reaction :  comms . hoecker , massey and breathitt all endorsed the order as an "" imperfect  solution , "" yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the  iso ' s market . comm . hebert faulted the commission for squandering an  opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls .  hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack  of the iso ' s progress , but contended that significant outstanding issues must  be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted .  in other action , ferc accepted nyiso ' s and nepool ' s proposed emergency energy  transaction agreement , allowing nyiso and iso - ne to provide emergency service  to each other ( ero 0 - 3638 - 000 ) ;  stricken items included cae - 16 ( nepool ' s 64 th agreement amendment proposing  the elimination of in service and instituting new rules governing certain  import transactions ( ero 0 - 3577 - 000 ) ) .  = = recent ferc filings = =  ( 1 ) rto developments  * iso ne submitted its changes to market rule 17 , market monitoring ,  reporting and market power mitigation , in compliance with the commission ' s  july 26 , 2000 order . erol - 368 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * iso ne submitted its special interim market rule in compliance with the  commission ' s july 26 , 2000 order . ero 0 - 369 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * illinois industrial energy consumers filed to intervene regarding dynegy ' s  filing to request approval for the withdrawal of the illinois power co . from  the miso . erol - 123 - 000 . filed november 6 , 2000 .  * el segundo power filed a motion "" requesting order on request for rehearing  by date certain "" in complaint that challenges the ca iso ' s ability to set the  rates for the energy that it can compel generators to produce for reliability  under its standard form contract . ero 0 - 1830 - 001 . filed november 3 , 2000 .  * ca iso filed an unbundled grid management charge in order to recover its  administrative and operating costs . erol - 313 - 000 . comments due by november  22 , 2000 .  * nepool submitted supplemental information related to its filing of the  sixty - fourth agreement amending the nepool agreement , which proposed the  elimination of in service . ero 0 - 3577 - 000 . comments due by november 14 , 2000 .

"Subject: a basic idea of price - offer matching clauses  vince -  here is the basic idea i was alluding to :  suppose a car dealer promised to "" match any advertised price . "" then his  competitor would feel the need to respond in kind . and so on , until all  dealers advertised they would "" match any advertised price . "" now , consider one  of these dealer ' s decision to perhaps lower his prices . if he does so ,  everyone will immediately match his price , so his market share will remain  unchanged , at whatever it was before , but his revenues ( and all other dealers  as well ) would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction . so , the  dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars .  now , suppose a limited partnership , where the partners contract to "" control ""  who they are in business with , by putting a "" right of first refusal "" clause  into the partnership ' s papers , whereby any partner wishing to sell his  interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the  partner received from outside for his shares . now , suppose you are an  outsider , considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want  to buy into the partnership . you know if your offer is a "" good "" one from your  perspective , offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return , the  existing partners will match it , and you will get nothing in the deal but you  will have paid , from your own pocket , for your due diligence . conversely , if  you offer too much for the shares , then the other partners will not match  your offer and you will then realize you overpaid . in neither case can you  credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current  partners . so , you ( basically ) don ' t make an offer . so , a partner ' s shares  are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers  he receives for them . the "" right of first refusal "" clause precludes  economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares  ( essentially ) illiquid .  clayton",0

"Subject: el paso statement on california situation  in case you haven ' t already seen this :  el paso addresses the california energy situation ( february 26 , 2001 )  houston , feb . 26 / prnewswire / - - el paso corporation ( nyse : epg )  reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties  involved to help improve california ' s energy situation . "" we are surprised  to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning el paso ' s  involvement in california , "" said norma dunn , senior vice president of  corporate communications and external affairs at el paso corporation . "" we  would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record . "" the  significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power  supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power , which  has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate  electricity . high natural gas prices are , therefore , an effect rather than  a cause of the power shortage . allegations that natural gas prices were  deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the el paso natural gas  pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue . it is not  possible for any holder of capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline to  cause a significant increase in california gas prices by refusing to use  that capacity . the el paso natural gas pipeline is required by law to post  the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is  obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate  found to be just and reasonable by the federal energy regulatory  commission . all capacity held by el paso merchant energy on the el paso  natural gas pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to  serve california and other western markets . allegations that there was a  "" conspiracy "" in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into  california are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge . the  facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990 s were either  built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer  support to justify their construction . for example , despite years of  marketing efforts by tenneco , not a single potential customer could be  induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed  altamont project to proceed . for that reason alone , it was ultimately  dropped . in 1996 , according to estimates , there were between one and two  billion cubic feet per day ( bcf / d ) of excess natural gas transportation  capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving california . indeed , it  was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess  capacity that prompted the california public utilities commission to  encourage pg & e , socal edison , and socal gas , beginning in 1996 and  continuing into 1998 , to relinquish over 1 . 5 bcf / d of firm transportation  capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline . processes are now under way  to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity  into california , and el paso intends to do its part to help satisfy  whatever needs may be established today . as recently as last year , there  were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available  on the el paso natural gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands  at that time . notwithstanding its availability , this capacity was not used  by shippers to california to fill in - state natural gas storage facilities  for future use . if california had taken advantage of the opportunity in  2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999 ,  reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in  prices at the california border could have been substantially mitigated or  avoided . it is now widely recognized that the california "" energy crisis ""  was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in california  to keep pace with the state ' s economy and increased demand . a combination  of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices . first , the construction  of new power plants in california is a slow , difficult , and heavily  regulated process . as a result , the growing demand has far outstripped  in - state generating capabilities . second , unfavorable precipitation and  increased out - of - state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power  normally relied on by california to become unavailable . third , increased  demand for power in the western united states drove up prices that  california had to pay to out - of - state generators . fourth , state policies  deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers ,  leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their  costs . fifth , because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased  costs to consumers , the utilities ' creditworthiness was impaired , causing  supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and  expensive to purchase . sixth , the early and greater - than - normal use of  peaking units - plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand  conditions - necessitated unscheduled maintenance , rendering them unavailable  at critical times . seventh , during the final months of 2000 , some power  plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air  emissions credits . eighth , a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold  weather further drove up demand for power . finally , the increased power  costs in california could have been substantially mitigated through  long - term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short - term  power market . "" california is currently in a difficult position , but now  has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long - term  energy policy , "" said dunn . "" el paso has been one of the largest suppliers  of energy to california for more than 50 years , and we are actively  participating with all parties in california to be a part of a long - term ,  stable solution to california ' s energy needs . "" el paso corporation , the  largest and most broadly based natural gas company in the world , spans the  energy value chain from wellhead to electron . with an enterprise value in  excess of $ 50 billion , el paso is a leader in every phase of the natural  gas industry . the company owns and operates a significant portion of the  north american natural gas delivery grid , operates the fastest growing ,  most sophisticated energy merchant group , and is the nation ' s third largest  natural gas producer . el paso , a leader in risk management techniques , is  focused on maximizing shareholder value , transforming existing markets , and  speeding the development of new markets . visit el paso at www . epenergy . com .  cautionary statement regarding forward - looking statements this release  includes forward - looking statements and projections , made in reliance on  the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act  of 1995 . the company has made every reasonable effort to ensure that the  information and assumptions on which these statements and projections are  based are current , reasonable , and complete . however , a variety of factors  could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections ,  anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this release . while  the company makes these statements and projections in good faith , neither  the company nor its management can guarantee that the anticipated future  results will be achieved . reference should be made to the company ' s ( and  its affiliates ' ) securities and exchange commission filings for additional  important factors that may affect actual results .  bob brooks  gpcm natural gas market forecasting system  http : / / gpcm . rbac . com",0

"" in texas , i think  we ' ve got a pretty good system , "" he said .  in san francisco on tuesday , the california public utilities commission  unanimously approved electricity rate increases of up to 46 percent to try to  head off blackouts this summer by keeping the state ' s two biggest utilities  from going under . when california officials set up deregulation they allowed  the price of wholesale electricity to rise but capped the amount companies  could charge customers , skilling said . socal edison and pacific gas &  electric say they have lost more than $ 13 billion since last summer because  they haven ' t been able to pass on the high cost of wholesale electricity .  skilling said texans are in a much better position and shouldn ' t worry that  their state ' s deregulation would be like the california experience .  "" california , they just put together a crazy system ,  8 he said in his first  public comments since becoming the houston - based company ' s chief executive  officer in february . "" the markets in california are the most regulated  markets in north america today . and that ' s what is causing the problem .

"Subject: california power 1 / 19 / 00  1 . legislation passes - short - term measures , very long - term measures  as we said yesterday , sb - 7 x passed the california state senate easily . the  bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the  department of water and resources until february 2 nd . the department will  have $ 400 million available to finance power purchases , but there  expectations that these costs could easily rise to $ 1 billion by next week .  ab - 1 x has evolved into a longer - term solution and in its current form , would  authorize the department of water and resources to enter into long - term  contracts ( as opposed to the 15 day contracts in sb - 7 x ) to buy power at a  price cap of 5 . 5 cents per kw / h . this legislation is not expected to pass  today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week  period covered by sb - 7 x , when negotiations between generators , the utilities ,  and the state are likely to resume .  a second piece of legislation under - - sb 6 x - - has created uncertainty in the  markets . this legislation will create a california public power authority  with bond issuance authority . the uncertainty concerns whether the new  authority will address the problem of the $ 12 billion in outstanding debt  owed by the utilities . the current text of the legislation focuses only on  longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving  efficiency . yet the legislation also says "" the authority may issue bonds ,  exercise power of eminent domain , and enter into joint power agreements and  buy , own , and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a  project . "" the general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of  either issuing bonds to finance past debts , or using eminent domain or the  bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a ch . 11 proceeding .  2 . default update  3 . bush  as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate  little interest in getting involved",0

"Subject: re : eprm article  chris ,  this is very well written and will serve the reader well . a few comments .  1 . when i think about the taxonomy of the var models , i typically use the  classification based on 3 categories :  a . variance / covariance method  b . historical simulation  c . monte carlo simulation .  delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear  instrument .  2 . i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation  of behavior of  all the market prices / rates , etc . , and revaluation of the entire portfolio .  the revaluation may be based on an approximation ( using taylor ' s expansion )  that may  involve delta , delta / gamma , delta / gamma / omega or may be exact ( based on the  same  model that produces the mark - to - market portfolio valuations ) .  the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the  ability to capture  the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way . i would  emphasize that  there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v / c model ( i shall send you  the references  from home ) .  3 . i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets  that are evolving  quickly ( new instruments for which we have no comparable prices ,  behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de - mature ) .  4 . for bigger portfolios , virtually all methods require some level of  aggregation into  atomic , elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem .  this process may be a source of a big error .  5 . the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing  of a portfolio that introduces no error . many swaps with the same underlying  can be aggregated into one positions ( they are portfolios of forwards and  they are linear  instruments ) .  please , feel free to use any comment ( or none ) .  vince  "" chris strickland "" on 08 / 28 / 2000 02 : 58 : 56 pm  please respond to "" chris strickland ""  to :  cc :  subject : eprm article  dear vince ,  ?  d you think you might be able to look at this in the next day or so ? robin  is after something by the end of this week .  ?  best regards .  ?  chris .  ?  - eprm _ 01 _ var . doc",0

"Subject: jcc  good morning . i apologize for the response delay . i ' ve gone back through  the analysis that i did back in april , and have thrown around some ideas with  vince and stinson . the issue may be summarized as follows .  the hedge relationship was derived using jcc and prompt brent , and is valid  for jcc and prompt brent . no problems here . however , it will not be valid  for points far out on the forward curve . intuitively , this hedge  relationship will approach one as we move far out on the curve , but since  there is no data , i can not statistically determine this . one can imagine a  term structure of heding ratios that start at 0 . 67 and move to 1 . 0 , so that  the back end of the curves would move together , but how fast it converges to  one is anyone ' s guess .  if there is a way of determining the historical jcc forward curve , then the  hedge relationships may be estimated . however , i have been unable to  determine a rigorous approach to building the jcc curve .  i can explain this far better in person , and would like to talk as soon as  possible at your convenience .  - kevin kindall",0

"Subject: pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to ,  which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating / score to price .  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model .  building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural  nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and  software packages to use ?  determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model .  getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present  such a price exists for very few credits .  allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would  take 6 - 10 man - months to develop .  further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy  asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' .  regards  ben",0

"Subject: re : full version  i read the chapter . generally ,  i like it , and find it non - controversial  and well written . of course , this is  a huge topic and there are things  that you haven ' t discussed .  i thought the amount of attention  paid to ols and mle estimation  was a bit overboard , given that you  didn ' t really exploit it in your  results . if you were to state  the likelihood function for  the garch model , it might justify  the amount of attention to  gave to estimation for  simple iid processes , which could then  be thought of as a simple lead - in  and intuition builder to  the more interesting models that  you do actually use .  by the way , in your discussion of  smiles , you discuss fat tails  extensively . at least for equity markets ,  while fat tails contribute , they don ' t do very  much at all compared to the effect  of risk premia , which you allude to briefly ,  using supply - demand language , at the  end of that section .  for the impact of risk premia , see  jun pan ' s paper , which is available  from her web page . but she covers  only sp 500 , ( as do most studies ) ,  and your markets are obviously much different .  the chapter will be a good service to your readers !  best , darrell  > x - lotus - fromdomain : ect  > from : "" vince j kaminski ""  > to : darrell duffie  > cc : "" grant masson "" , "" vince j kaminski ""  > date : wed , 16 aug 2000 16 : 37 : 53 - 0500  > subject : re : full version  > mime - version : 1 . 0  > content - disposition : inline  > x - uidl : 00453 eda 98 c 82 d 709 e 6123 af 537 e 4 f 63  > x - keywords :  >  >  >  > darrell ,  >  > thanks a lot . i really appreciate it . the text is below our usual  > standards but we are completely swamped with work here .  >  > vince  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  > darrell duffie on 08 / 15 / 2000 04 : 54 : 23 pm  >  > please respond to darrell duffie  >  > to : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com  > cc :  > subject : re : full version  >  >  > i ' ll have a look !  >  > i haven ' t much time , but can certainly  > get you a quick reaction , at least !  >  > best , darrell  >  >  > > x - lotus - fromdomain : ect  > > from : "" vince j kaminski ""  > > to : duffie @ stanford . edu  > > date : thu , 10 aug 2000 14 : 04 : 47 - 0500  > > subject : full version  > > mime - version : 1 . 0  > > content - disposition : inline  > > x - uidl : 9 fef 7462 afa 5 d 4 ee 6 co 4 c 9 co 2 df 71 b 25  > > x - keywords :  > >  > >  > >  > > darrell ,  > >  > > grant just alerted me that i sent you only part of the text .  > >  > > here is the full chapter with an aged version of gran ' t part .  > > what i sent you represents an update of his contribution .  > >  > > sorry for that .  > >  > > vince  > >  > > ( see attached file : volo 720 . doc )  >  > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  > darrell duffie  > mail gsb stanford ca 94305 - 5015 usa  > phone 650 723 1976  > fax 650 725 7979  > email duffie @ stanford . edu  > web http : / / www . stanford . edu / ~ duffie /  > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  darrell duffie  mail gsb stanford ca 94305 - 5015 usa  phone 650 723 1976  fax 650 725 7979  email duffie @ stanford . edu  web http : / / www . stanford . edu / ~ duffie / ",0

"Subject: hedge effectiveness test for fair value hedges  gentlemen :  we have had favorable responses regarding the use of our volatility  reduction method ( roger , i ' ve attached a copy of our article in case you  hadn ' t seen it ) . however , there continued to be a quibble about how to  create the set of data points that would be inputs into the testing process .  last week the consulting arm of a "" big five "" accounting firm indicated that  the following method proposed by us would be acceptable . we believe this  method overcomes the statistical problems that arise from using interest  rate differences from overlapping ( "" rolling "" ) quarters .  method :  1 ) calculate daily yield curve changes expressed as ratios , using historical  rates from the most recent , say , two years . ( note : no overlap ) . this  results in a set of around 494 vectors of ratios ( approximately 247 trading  days per  year ) .  example :  if the first three yield curves in the historical set look like this :  19980801 6 . 5 6 . 6 6 . 7 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 2  19980802 6 . 3 6 . 3 6 . 6 . . . . . . . . . 6 . 9  19980803 6 . 6 6 . 8 6 . 9 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 1  then the change from 8 / 1 / 98 to 8 / 2 / 98 is :  6 . 3 / 6 . 5 6 . 3 / 6 . 6 6 . 6 / 6 . 7 . . . . . . . . . . 6 . 9 / 7 . 1  and the change from 8 / 2 / 98 to 8 / 3 / 98 is :  6 . 6 / 6 . 3 6 . 8 / 6 . 3 6 . 9 / 6 . 6 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 1 / 6 . 9  2 ) randomly select 62 of these "" ratio "" vectors ( approx . 62 trading days in a  quarter ) .  3 ) multiply these ratio vectors together to get a single vector ( ie , the 62  6 mo ratios are multiplied together , the 62 lyr ratios are multiplied  togeter , etc . ) . the result represents a single quarterly yield curve  transformation . apply it to "" today ' s "" yield curve . the resulting yield  curve represents one simulated quarterly change in interest rates  4 ) repeat steps 2 and 3 until an adequate number of yield curves are  generated , say 100 .  5 ) proceed with testing process .  i would be interested in your comments .  leslie abreo  andrew kalotay associates , inc .  61 broadway , ste 3025  new york ny 10006  phone : ( 212 ) 482 0900  fax : ( 212 ) 482 0529  email : leslie . abreo @ kalotay . com  visit aka ' s website at http : / / www . kalotay . com  - fasl 33 article . pdf",0

"Subject: fw : fyi - more on truck s / d  vince :  i ' d like to send you some articles on the fleet card business .  if you have some time , i ' d like to discuss the meeting that we had with  comdata ( which has a 60 % market share of the fleet card business ) . they have  some live data that potentially could be very interesting ; however , i ' d like  to discuss it with you .  shawn  what a mess ! ( statistical data included )  john d . schulz  03 / 26 / 2001  traffic world  page 25  copyright 2001 gale group inc . all rights reserved . copyright 2001 journal of  commerce , inc .  truckers still waiting for signs of pent - up freight demand ; earnings  shortfalls , layoffs loom  if you are waiting for trucking to kick - start the nation ' s economic recovery ,  pull up a chair and wait awhile . trucking ceos say they haven ' t seen this  slow a first quarter in a decade .  "" perhaps the weakest first quarter for freight demand since swift became a  public company in 1990 , "" phoenix - based swift transportation chairman and ceo  jerry moyes said .  the first - quarter trucking mantra historically has been this : everybody loses  money in january , hopes for a break - even february and earns whatever profit  there is in the quarter in march . that formula may not hold this year .  gregory l . quesnel , president and ceo of con - way transportation services and  emery worldwide parent cnf inc . , said the current slowdown was first detected  late in the third quarter last year and has become "" more pronounced in each  successive quarter . "" march , he said , has been "" as disappointing as the first  two months this year . ""  layoffs already are occurring at the major ltl carriers . yellow freight  system has idled as many as 1 , 000 teamsters and hundreds of white - collar  back - office workers . most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls  that will cause them to miss analysts ' first - quarter estimates . but there are  deeper fears , too . marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy . small ,  family - owned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms  because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing  some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years  ago .  swift ' s volume drop - off began with shipments originating on the west coast in  january and february and it is continuing in march , moyes said . coupled with  reduced demand from the southwest , moyes said swift will not meet analysts '  first - quarter earnings expectations . swift is not alone .  "" we hauled less freight in february than february a year ago , "" said bob  hammel , executive vice president of pittsburgh - based pitt ohio express , a  leading privately held eastern regional ltl carrier . "" the slowdown in  manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous . nobody  anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off . ""  even con - way , the most profitable ltl operation in the past five years , said  it would have a decline in first - quarter operating income compared with the  year - ago period . con - way ' s tonnage declines were estimated in the  "" mid - single - digit "" percentage range .  roadway express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to  11 percent below those a year ago , which will result in an approximately  one - half of 1 percent ( 0 . 5 percent ) decline in its operating ratio . ( see  sidebar )  pat hanley , overnite transportation ' s senior vice president and chief  financial officer , said freight figures were flat in february year over year  but rose slightly in march . overnite is the exception to the ltl industry  with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year .  "" january was pretty good to us , but february was flat . it ' s coming back in  march . we ' re probably up in low single digits , 3 to 4 percent . we ' re picking  back up . the economy has hurt us . if you had asked us at the start of the  year , we ' d have said we ' d be up double - digits , "" hanley said .  the national economic picture is "" a big concern , "" hanley said . "" we ' re not  seeing pressure on prices , at least not so far . we ' re seeing customers ship  10 pallets a day instead of 20 . the shipment size is coming down . certainly  we ' re concerned . we ' ll do o . k . , but not as great as we ' d like . ""  forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever  stars align in federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan ' s world . the  genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking , which  is always a first - in , first - out industry in any economic slowdown .  to hear trucking industry leaders tell it , get comfortable with beans and  franks for dinner . it ' s going to be awhile before it ' s filet mignon time  again .  shippers see what ' s happening as well but say it ' s still too early in the  year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks .  "" all the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business  levels - - definitely slower than early last year , "" said bill huie , assistant  vice president of corporate transportation for nch corp . , irving , texas .  "" with a couple of exceptions , carriers we talk with have no plans for  expansion in the next few months . we are getting feelers about some possible  lane adjustments to boost revenue . but generally it appears a little early in  the economic downturn for much price movement . ""  the national ltl carriers are seeing the same things . "" our business is down  pretty substantially for the first quarter , "" said roger dick , spokesman for  yellow corp . , parent of yellow freight system and two large regional ltl  carriers , jevic transportation , delanco , n . j . , and saia motor freight ,  duluth , ga .  usfreightways corp . , citing what it called the nation ' s "" serious economic  slowdown , "" said it expects first - quarter earnings to fall "" very substantially  below "" current wall street consensus .  extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating  environment , usf chairman , president and ceo samuel k . skinner added .  "" traditionally , the first quarter builds momentum slowly , with march being  the strongest month of the period , "" skinner said in a statement . "" this year ,  the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in january  and february , softening even the normal modest expectations for those two  months . ""  it ' s not just the ltl industry that ' s hurting . the morgan stanley dean witter  truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand - supply  relationship since analyst james j . valentine began tracking the data in  april 1994 . two events can cause weakness in the index , according to  valentine . they are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak  freight demand .  "" so far in 2001 , we have seen the confluence of both factors , but the  fall - off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply , "" valentine wrote  in his most recent "" trucking snapshot "" for early march .  year - to - date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over  year , according to valentine ' s index , while supply is up only 7 percent . that  would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was  "" masked by the strong economy , "" valentine says .  in a more ominous note , valentine believes overcapacity will continue to  plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years . only a  reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand - supply back in balance  for the truckload sector in the near term , valentine predicts .  the overproduction of new class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last  year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at  manufacturers , wholesalers and other retailers . used trucks have lost on  average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months .  anecdotally , one used truck dealer , music city truck & equipment , in  lavergne , tenn . , is holding a "" two - for - one "" sale on three - to five - year - old  class 8 freightliners . you can buy two for around $ 30 , 000 , less than a brand  new chevy suburban suv .  what that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 class 8 truck for $ 70 , 000 and  depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the  books this year at $ 35 , 000 . but assuming it has lost 30 percent of that  value , it may only be worth $ 24 , 500 in actuality . for a carrier with a  100 - truck fleet , that equates to a loss of more than $ 1 million on assets .  the glut may last for a while , according to valentine ' s analysis . assuming a  three - year trade - in cycle , most of the class 8 tractors in the truckload  sector are just now rolling over to the used - truck market . that means that  overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year .  that will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business , as  did nearly 1 , 900 carriers last year that either closed or declared  bankruptcy .  "" we can see from indexes , surveys and other information available to us that  it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in march and freight  demands will continue to be soft throughout the month . based on all of these  factors , we expect usfreightways ' profits for the first quarter to be very  substantially less than published analysts ' forecasts , "" skinner said .  in addition , severe weather conditions including an earthquake in seattle ,  rainstorms in california and blizzards in the northeast have added cost and  decreased efficiencies , skinner added .  expectations at each of usf ' s operating companies have been affected , some  more than others . the ltl , logistics , reverse logistics and  freight - forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a  similar period last year , skinner said .  further job cuts at usf worldwide , its freight forwarder , would be in the  offing as cost controls at the unit would be "" accelerated "" in the wake of the  softening economy , skinner said . late last year , skinner said the rebuilding  process at usf worldwide would be a two - year process . but the worsening  economy has made that rebuilding job harder , he said .  "" we are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is , in fact , further  impeding progress in this area , "" skinner said . "" during the fourth quarter of  2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001 , the company has taken  steps to increase cost efficiencies . among these actions are a substantial  cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force .  these cost - control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance  the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions .
